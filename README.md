GitHub - Task list completed PR check
=========================

Install from the Marketplace: https://github.com/marketplace/task-list-completed

The check will not pass until all task lists have been checked.

You can use this to check manual tests or requirements have been ticked off before the pull request can be merged.

## Contributing

TODO: unit tests & travis CI

For now, on Glitch you can click to "remix to edit" and then work on your own forked version.
Then if you have ideas to bring over, you can submit an issue to discuss them or a pull request with the code changes.
Thank you.

## Development for main repo

Code runs on Glitch, `git push glitch` & then in glitch, click tools > console and run `refresh`.
Permission changes would need to be changed in the app on github.

## Security

The code is all here to see & available on the Glitch link below which is also where the service runs.
No data about your user or repo is logged.

If you discover a security issue please email it to myself at andrew@stapps.io and I will get back to you asap. For all other issues or help you can create an issue on this project - Thank you.
